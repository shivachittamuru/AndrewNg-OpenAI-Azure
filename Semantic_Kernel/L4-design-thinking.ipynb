       "\n",

       "\n",
       "4. Skepticism: The man may view the loyalty card with skepticism, questioning the actual value of the rewards and doubting whether it is worth his time and effort to participate. He may be hesitant to believe that the rewards are genuinely beneficial.\n",

       "5. Positivity: Surprisingly, the loyalty card might have a positive impact on the man's mood.

This positive reaction could potentially uplift his mood and make him more open to enjoying his time at the bar.\n",
